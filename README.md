Point Comparison Project
Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Point class in C++ with two primary functionalities:

Comparison of Points: Checks if two points are equal based on their x and y coordinates.
Point Output: Outputs the coordinates of a point in a readable format using << operator overloading.
Files
main.cpp: Contains the main function and example usage of the Point class.
Point.hpp: Contains the declaration of the Point struct and overloaded operators.
Point.cpp: Contains the implementation of the Point classâ€™s operator functions.
Explanation of Code
Equality Operator (==): Defined in Point.cpp, this operator checks if two Point instances have identical x and y values.
Stream Insertion Operator (<<): Outputs the Point coordinates in a user-friendly format (x, y).
Requirements
A C++ compiler is required to compile the project.
